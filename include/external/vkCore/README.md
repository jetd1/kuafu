# vkCore
A single-header Vulkan framework.

### Issues

- [ ] Deal with third party includes
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Compute queue family and compute queue are not handled
- [ ] Add a user-defined feature check when evaluating a physical device (maybe an OO-approach is required)
- [ ] Update get*Info function names
- [ ] Make single-header optional and provide framework with multiple files as well as third party files
- [ ] Potentially remove very high level functions and classes such as environment map
- [ ] Add an example
- [ ] Add doxygen documentation (hosted directly on GitHub)
